		<p class="film description hidden">The composer’s fee can be either a negotiated 
			figure or part of a “package”—i.e., the portion of the music 
			budget remaining after paying musicians, producing a soundtrack, 
			and buying rights to existing music. Music budgets range from 
			1% to 10% (usually 3-5%) of overall budget. In studio films, the 
			composer works “for hire” as the producer “buys out” all rights 
			to music. With independent films and documentaries the composer 
			can often negotiate certain rights in exchange for a lower fee. 
			Credits as performer, orchestrator, and leader allow the composer 
			to receive a package of benefits through the American Federation 
			of Musicians. Screenings in the United States do not produce 
			composer royalties, but the performing rights societies collect 
			licensing fees for their member composers for television 
			broadcasts and screenings abroad—which can amount to a 
			considerable income if composer has retained publishing rights.</p>
		<p class="film description hidden">The ranges above indicate typical net 
			composer fees, depending on film budget, rights retained, and 
			composer’s prestige. A composer seeking exposure may accept less.</p>
