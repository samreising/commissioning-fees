		<p class="television hidden">The composer’s fee is usually 
			negotiated as part of a “package”—i.e., the portion 
			of the music budget remaining after paying musicians, 
			producing a soundtrack, and buying the rights to music. 
			Performing rights societies pay composer royalties on 
			“performances” (broadcasts)—more for networks and cable, 
			less for public television. Credits as performer, 
			orchestrator, and leader allow the composer to receive 
			a package of benefits through the American Federation of 
			Musicians. The following ranges represent what a composer 
			typically nets. A composer seeking exposure may accept 
			less.</p>
