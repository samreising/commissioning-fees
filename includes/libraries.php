		<p class="libraries description hidden">Production Music Libraries offer 
			media producers a collection of pre-recorded tracks that 
			can be licensed for a pre-determined fee. Composers are 
			usually hired to create music under a “work-for-hire” 
			agreement, retaining the right to collect the writer’s 
			share of performance fees from broadcasts of their music.</p>
		<p class="libraries description hidden">While revenues are typically less 
			than from original compositions, the growing popularity of 
			production music libraries and the panoply of music styles they 
			require has provided opportunities for many composers to augment 
			their careers with this type of work.</p>
