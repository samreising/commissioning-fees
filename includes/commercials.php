		<p class="commercials hidden">Most music heard in commercials 
			is created by production houses which employ composers 
			“for hire” and hold all rights to their music. The 
			composer’s Creative Fee can be as much as 25-50% of 
			the overall music budget, although typically this is 
			shared with contributing producers. Other than national 
			network spots, performing rights societies do not 
			always log broadcast of commercials, so the composer’s 
			future income depends on royalties as composer, paid 
			by producer, and American Federation of Musicians 
			recording payment as performer, arranger, or leader. 
			The following ranges represent what a composer typically 
			nets. A composer seeking exposure may accept less.</p>
