		<p class="description">An advance against royalties may be negotiated. This can be up to $10,000 or more for an experienced
musical theater composer. The royalty is a negotiable percentage of gross box office receipts. The
Dramatists Guild contracts with Broadway producers and theaters specify that Author (the composer,
book-writer, and lyricist are collectively referred to as “Author”) receive 4.5% pre-recoupment (i.e. until
producers recoup their investment) and 6% post-recoupment. In Off-Broadway and regional theaters, it
is not uncommon for Author to receive 6%, with 1-2% increase after recoupment in for-profit
productions. Royalties in non-profit theaters generally work the same way. How the Author royalty is split,
as well as rights for any future exploitation of the work, are usually covered in collaboration agreements.</p>
		<p class="description">An alternative arrangement known as a “profit pool” is becoming the standard, particularly for musicals.
In a profit pool the composer is part of a group of royalty participants. Other royalty participants include
the book writer, lyricist, director, choreographer and others. Royalty participants are paid a share of 40%
of box office receipts minus operating expenses. The other 60% is distributed entirely to investors prerecoupment
and split equally between producers and investors post-recoupment. Consult the Dramatists
Guild or an experienced attorney for guidance on these complex arrangements.</p>
