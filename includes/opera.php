	<p class = "opera description hidden">Because revivals of new 
		operas are relatively rare, most composers rely primarily 
		on commissions. Fees depend on the length of the work and 
		the kind of company offering the commission. Librettist 
		fees can be a separate flat fee or a percentage of the 
		composer’s fee, typically 15-30%. The ranges above are 
		inclusive of librettist fees. Librettists also receive 
		a portion—traditionally half—of any royalties for the work. 
		Composers and librettists should enter into a collaboration 
		agreement that specifies details of copyright ownership, 
		the merging of the copyright in the completed work, and 
		royalty arrangements.</p>
	<p class = "opera description hidden">Grand rights for 
		performances after the premiere are negotiated with the 
		composer or publisher in one of three ways: as a flat fee 
		for the run; based on the number of seats in hall; or as a 
		percentage of box office gross income.</p>
